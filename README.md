## Selected Topic 🌾🌽
Agriculture is extremely important to the world economy. Understanding global agricultural output is critical for tackling food security concerns (hunger) as the human population continues to grow.

**Crop yield prediction** is a significant agricultural problem. Agricultural yield is largely influenced by meteorological conditions (rain, temperature, etc.) and pesticides, and reliable information about crop yield history is critical for making agricultural risk management and future predictions choices.

World hunger is now increasing, after having declined for a decade. This trend is expected to last, while being amplified by the alarming population increase. 

We picked top 20 most populated countries of the world to analyze this issue at a macroscopic level and present suggestions that can be implemented to prevent the growing gap between world hunger and crop yield.

Our project consists of three main sections:

- **Prediction** 👩‍🌾👨🏿‍🌾📈: We trained our ML model on previous data to predict future total yield of selected crops to help current and new farmers/business owners make an informed decision based on their existing area conditions (rain, temperature, pesticides).
- **Analysis** 🌦️: In this section, we want to give the users visual representation of different weather phenomena that would affect their crop yield.
- **Recommendations** 🌱: We are trying to advise farmers top three crops to grow in their respective countries (based on each countries' average temperature, rainfall and used pesticide) to maximize total crop yield.  

## Description of the Source Data
We found our datasets for this project on Kaggle: [Crop_Yield_Prediction_Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset?select=yield.csv)

We will be using Amazon Web Services to store our data.

*All dataset (publicly available dataset) on Kaggle are taken from [FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) and [World Data Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).*

## Communication Protocols
We meet once a week in person and go over details fo the project for upcoming weeks. We also communicate regularly via Whatsapp, Slack and do regular Zoom sessions to keep each other informed about the status of our respective aspects of the project. 

Here is a picture of us refueling 😋:

## Visualization
***Under Construction 🚧🚧🚧***

We have started building our dashboard as a website containing interactive visualization and forecast generated by our ML model.

You can find the initial plan of our website here:

## Machine Learning
-- ML explanation will come here!


## Database
We have several primary-composite keys, and the tables have Many-to-Many relationships. All the four tables in our ERD have Country and Year columns, and their data type is varchar and int, respectively. All the tables have a column expressing the table's name, and their data type are int and float. In addition, the yield table has an Item column that represents the crops, and its data type is varchar. After creating the tables in pgadmin, we extracted the CSV files from Amazon S3 by utilizing pyspark in google colaboratory. Then, we connected our PostgreSQL to AWS relational database with the aid of JDBC. Finally, we wrote the CSV files into our RDS. Here you can find the ERD for our database:
