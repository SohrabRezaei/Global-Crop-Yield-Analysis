## Selected Topic
Agriculture is extremely important to the world economy. Understanding global agricultural output is critical for tackling food security concerns and mitigating the effects of climate change and global warming as the human population continues to grow.

**Crop yield prediction** is a significant agricultural problem. Agricultural yield is largely influenced by meteorological conditions (rain, temperature, etc.), pesticides, and reliable information about crop yield history is critical for making agricultural risk management and future predictions choices.

## Description of the Source Data
We found our datasets for this project on Kaggle: [Crop_Yield_Prediction_Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset?select=yield.csv)

We will be using Amazon Web Services to store our data.

*All dataset (publicly available dataset) on Kaggle are taken from [FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) and [World Data Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).*

## Communication Protocols
We meet once a week in person and go over details fo the project for upcoming weeks. We also communicate regularly via Whatsapp, Slack and do regular Zoom sessions to keep each other informed about the status of our respective aspects of the project. 

Here is a picture of us collaborating:

## Database
We will be using PostgreSQL for our project. We have primary-composit keys. The tables have Many-to-Many relationship. Here you can find the ERD for our database:
